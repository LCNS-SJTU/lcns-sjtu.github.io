Welcome to **Lab of Computational Neuroscience**!

We are powered by mathematical modeling and computational techniques to seek insights about the brain across multiple scales of space and time. Our interdisciplinary research including various topics:

1. Dynamics of Large-scale neuronal network.
2. Network reconstruction based on causal inference.
3. Single neuron models and dendritic computations.
4. Brain inspired AI.
5. Computational Psychaitry.
