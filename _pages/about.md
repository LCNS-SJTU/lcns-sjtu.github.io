Welcome to the **Lab of Computational Neuroscience**!

The lab of computational neuroscience at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn) is co-directed by [Douglas Zhou](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/zdz/) and [Songting Li](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/songtingli/). It involves a diverse team with expertise of mathematics, physics, computer science and biology, sharing a common interest in understaindg how the brain works. In general, the research in the lab applies mathematical modeling and computational techniques to investigate principles of neuronal computation across spatiotemporal scales, including dendritic computation of a single neuron, dynamics of neuronal circuitry and large-scale networks, and brain-inspired machine learning algorithms. The lab is in quest of mathematical understanding of brain computation with a close collaboration with experimental laboratories.
